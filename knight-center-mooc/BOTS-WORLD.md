# Building Bots: Global Considerations

This course is available to anyone around the world with an internet connection. Welcome from wherever you are!

We'll be using a variety of online services to build and use our bots, and unfortunately some of those services may not be available in some parts of the world. And while the bots we're building generally work in other languages, some of the services we use are not yet compatible to all languages.

If you're outside of the United States, take a look at the information below to see if there are parts of this class you won't be able to try yourself:

## Service Detail and Availability

If you are in an area where major global providers are blocked -- such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook -- there will be big parts of this course you won't be able to try for yourself. Other students outside of the United States might find one of the other services unavailable to them. Here are some resources to help you figure that out:

### Dexter

[Dexter](https://rundexter.com) is our bot-building platform. It should be available wherever global internet service is available.

Dexter uses pattern-matching in its responses to human input, so non-English characters -- and even emoji -- shouldn't be a problem (though I haven't tested all cases).

### Dialogflow

[Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com) is a natural language processor -- which turns human language, either spoken or typed, into data a computer program can use to understand what the human is saying. Dialogflow is a Google product, and requires a [Google account](https://accounts.google.com). If you don't have access to Google, Dialogflow likely won't work for you.

For the class, we'll be using Dialogflow in English. As long as you are comfortable in English -- enough to understand me in the videos! -- you'll be fine. If later you'd like to use Dialogflow in another language, or several languages, [check out this page](https://dialogflow.com/docs/multi-language) to see what it can do.

### Twilio

[Twilio](https://twilio.com) is a communications service we'll use for SMS texting during the first half of the thrid week.

The world of SMS is a crazy web of services and phone carriers, so your experience outside of North America could be tricky. That said, I've used the examples in this class in several countries, and with people who have phones from many countries.

In the class I'll walk you through getting a (free) Twilio phone number to use as a test. It will be easiest to get a Twilio phone number in your own country, and that number will need domestic SMS capabilities. [Check this list](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223183068-Twilio-international-phone-number-availability-and-their-capabilities#sms_enabled) to see if Twilio phone numbers in your country are available for domestic SMS texting -- they'll be noted with "GA" or "Beta."

If Twilio phone numbers are _not_ available for SMS texting in your country, you may be able to get a Twilio number in a nearby country and then set that number to text internationally to your country. Details on this possible workaround [can be found here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/guides/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account#sending-messages-internationally).

### Airtable

[Airtable](https://airtable.com) is a spreadsheet service that should be available wherever global internet access is available.

### Amazon Alexa

Roughly half of the third week will include playing with Amazon's voice system, Alexa, online. You can do these lessons without an Alexa-enabled device (such as an Echo).

The experience is even better if you actually _have_ an Amazon-enabled device. According to [this article](https://www.geekwire.com/2017/amazon-bringing-echo-alexa-80-additional-countries-major-global-expansion/), they are now (or becoming) available in dozens of countries. But your experience may vary.

Again, only if you're going further with actual devices and future bots: Alexa systems are triggered by voice, and they only recognize a few languages. For the latest information on available languages, see [this page](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/develop-skills-in-multiple-languages.html) on in the Alexa documentation.

### Facebook Messenger

[Facebook Messenger](https://messenger.com) and [Facebook Developer Accounts](https://developers.facebook.com/) require a main [Facebook](https://facebook.com) account. If Facebook is not available in your area, you won't be able to participate in the last week of the course.
